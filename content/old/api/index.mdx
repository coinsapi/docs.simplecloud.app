# Getting Started with SimpleCloud API

Welcome to SimpleCloud's API documentation. Our API ecosystem provides a powerful, flexible foundation for building and integrating cloud services, extending far beyond traditional Minecraft server management.

## Introduction

SimpleCloud's API represents a major leap forward in cloud service management. At its core, it provides a component-based architecture enabling modular development across your infrastructure. Through our implementation of [gRPC](https://grpc.io/), we deliver cross-platform compatibility that breaks free from traditional constraints. The API is completely language-agnostic, allowing integrations in virtually any programming environment.

## Architecture

### Component-Based Design

SimpleCloud's ecosystem is structured into distinct components that work together seamlessly while maintaining independence:

- **Controllers**: Central management units handling service orchestration and resource allocation
- **Droplets**: Independent service units providing scalable components and specialized functionality
- **Plugin System**: Extends the platform's capabilities through modular additions

This component-based approach allows developers to import only the dependencies they need, maintaining clean architecture and optimizing resource usage.

### Protocol Buffers & gRPC

The foundation of our API rests on two powerful technologies:

- **[Protocol Buffers](https://protobuf.dev/)**: Efficient binary serialization with strong typing
- **[gRPC](https://grpc.io/)**: High-performance remote procedure calls with bi-directional streaming

You can find our complete Protocol Buffer specifications at [buf.build/simplecloud/proto-specs](https://buf.build/simplecloud/proto-specs/).

## Authentication

<Tabs items={["Minecraft Server", "External Application"]}>
<Tab value="Minecraft Server">
Every Minecraft server automatically receives an API key through environment variables:

```bash
# Automatically set in Minecraft server environment
CONTROLLER_SECRET=sk_....
```

Our official APIs automatically detect and use these credentials.

</Tab>

<Tab value="External Application">
For applications outside the Minecraft server environment, use the master authentication secret located at:

```bash
/components/.secrets/auth.secret
```

<Callout type="warning">
  This master secret provides full API access. Never commit it to version control,
  store it securely in production environments, and implement regular secret rotation.
</Callout>
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Access Control System

SimpleCloud implements a comprehensive access control system with:

- Fine-grained permission management
- Token-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Usage monitoring
- Audit logging capabilities

<Callout>
  The access control system is fully implemented. We're currently integrating it
  with the [CLI](/manual/cli) and [Dashboard](/manual/dashboard) for easier key
  management.
