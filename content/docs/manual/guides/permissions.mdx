  Learn how to migrate v2 permissions to LuckPerms
---

## Run the migration

SimpleCloud v3 does not include a built-in permission system. Instead, we recommend using [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/download), the industry standard for Minecraft permission management.

If you're upgrading from SimpleCloud v2, we provide a migration tool to convert your existing permissions to LuckPerms:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Enable maintenance mode or whitelist on all servers to prevent players to
    join during the migration
  </Step>
  <Step>
    [Download](https://github.com/theSimpleCloud/permission-migration) and
    install the permission migration on a sub-server e.g. on a lobby instance.
    Do not perform the migration on the Proxy server!
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Install and configure [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/download) on the
    selected sub-server and set it up correctly
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Restart the server after installing LuckPerms to apply the changes
  </Step>
  <Step>Run `/migrate` command in the console</Step>
  <Step>
    Complete the data migration. All permission data will be migrated. Verify
    successful permission migration
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout>
  The migration tool automatically handles the conversion of all permissions,
  groups, and user data from your v2 installation.

## Why LuckPerms?

Luckperms is a powerful and user-friendly permissions plugin for Minecraft servers, offering many great features such as support for various server platforms and databases, real-time syncing across all servers, backup and restore functionality, and an intuitive dashboard.
Instead of "reinventing the wheel" by creating our own permission system, we highly recommend using or switching to Luckperms. (We are not partnered with Luckperms or affiliated with them in any way.)

## Best Practices

1. **Network Setup**

   - Use a central database for multi-server setups
   - Keep plugin versions consistent across servers
   - Regular permission data backups

2. **Permission Management**
   - Use the web editor for complex changes
   - Implement clear group hierarchies
   - Document permission assignments
