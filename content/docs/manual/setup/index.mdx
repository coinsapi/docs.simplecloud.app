## Installing SimpleCloud

Installing SimpleCloud is simple with our one-line command:

<Tabs items={["Unix", "Windows"]}>
<Tab>

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theSimpleCloud/simplecloud-manifest/HEAD/install.sh)" && sc setup
```

</Tab>
<Tab>
  <Callout type="warn">
    While our CLI theoretically works on Windows, we do not recommend it for
    production use. The installation will be added when we have a better Windows
    support.
  </Callout>
</Tab>

</Tabs>

This command installs the SimpleCloud CLI and immediately runs the setup wizard in a single step.

## Starting SimpleCloud

The setup wizard will automatically start SimpleCloud for you. If you need to start it manually, you can use the following command:

```bash
simplecloud start cloud
```

This command initiates the cloud and prepares it for use.

## Accessing the Dashboard

SimpleCloud provides a web-based dashboard for managing your Minecraft network. To access it:

```bash
simplecloud login dashboard
```

This command will display a link to access the dashboard.

<Callout type="warn">
  This link contains authentication credentials and should NOT be shared with
  others. Each user should generate their own login link.
</Callout>

## Verifying Installation

To check that everything is running correctly:

```bash
simplecloud status
```

This command displays the status of all SimpleCloud components.
