## Understanding the Dashboard

The dashboard provides a powerful web-based interface for managing your Minecraft network. Like the [CLI](/concepts/cli), it allows you to manage your cloud instance, serving as an interface that sends commands to the controller or droplets and retrieves information.

## Key Features

The dashboard offers several powerful features to help you manage your cloud:

- **Server Insights**: Start, stop, and monitor individual sub-servers on their dedicated pages with integrated console and file browser
- **Group Management**: Create and edit server groups with all essential information available on the group overview page
- **File Browser**: Edit templates through our integrated file browser - upload new worlds, modify configurations, or edit files directly
- **Custom Branding**: Customize the dashboard with your logo, project name, and custom banners for server groups

Coming soon:

- **Users and Permissions**: Create roles for your developers
- **Monitoring**: View extensive statistics about your cloud instance with clear graphs (requires Metrics Droplet)

## Accessing the Dashboard

You can access the dashboard in two ways:

### Using the CLI (Recommended)

The simplest way to access the dashboard is through the CLI:

```bash
simplecloud login dashboard
```

This command will display a secure login link.

<Callout type="warn">
  The login link contains authentication credentials and should NOT be shared
  with others. Each user should generate their own login link.
</Callout>

### Using the Hosted Dashboard

For those who prefer not to use the CLI, you can access our hosted dashboard directly:

<Image

    "https://github.com/simplecloudapp/branding/blob/main/media/dashboard/login.png?raw=true"
  }
  alt="SimpleCloud Dashboard Login"
/>

1. Visit [dashboard.simplecloud.app](http://dashboard.simplecloud.app)
2. Enter your controller endpoint (Example: `187.420.69.31:1337`)
3. Enter your controller secret (found in `/components/.secrets/auth.secret`)

<Callout>
  Note that the dashboard is just an interface - you cannot start the controller
  directly from it. The controller must be running locally before you can
  connect to it through the dashboard.
</Callout>

## Self-Hosting the Dashboard

<Callout type="warn">
  Self-hosting is not available during the Public Beta while we focus on
  squashing major bugs. This ensures you won't need to deal with frequent
  updates after launch. Stay updated through our [Community
  Discord](https://discord.simplecloud.com).
