## What are Servers?

Servers are individual Minecraft instances that SimpleCloud creates and manages based on your group configurations. Each server:

- Inherits its base configuration from its parent group
- Has a unique identifier (e.g., `lobby-1`, `survival-3`)
- Can be individually managed and configured
- Automatically scales based on player demand

## Server Lifecycle

### Creation and Startup

Servers are automatically created when:

- The configured minimum online count hasn't been reached
- You manually start a server
- Player count requires more capacity based on your scaling settings

### Runtime Operation

During operation, servers:

- Report their status to the SimpleCloud controller
- Handle player connections
- Can be modified with certain settings without requiring restarts

### Shutdown

Servers are gracefully stopped when:

- You manually stop them
- They're no longer needed (player count decreases)
- The cloud system shuts down

## Managing Servers

### Starting a Server

```bash
simplecloud start server <server-id>
```

Example:

```bash
simplecloud start server lobby-1
```

### Stopping a Server

```bash
simplecloud stop server <server-id>
```

Example:

```bash
simplecloud stop server survival-2
```

### Editing a Running Server

Some properties can be changed while a server is running:

```bash
simplecloud edit server <server-id> [flags]
```

**Available Flags:**

- `-P, --max-players uint`: Change the maximum player limit
- `-r, --properties stringToString`: Modify custom properties (key=value pairs)

Example:

```bash
# Change max players on a specific server
simplecloud edit server lobby-1 --max-players 100
```

You can define custom properties for your servers:

```bash
simplecloud edit server lobby-1 --properties "custom-property=value"
```

These properties can be accessed by plugins through the SimpleCloud API to enable custom behaviors and configurations.

## Server States

Servers transition through different states during their lifecycle:

- **PREPARING**: Server files are being prepared
- **STARTING**: Server is starting up but not ready yet
- **RUNNING**: Server is operational and can accept players
- **STOPPING**: Server is in the process of shutting down
- **STOPPED**: Server has been fully stopped

<Callout type="info">
  You can view the current state of all servers using the `simplecloud info
  servers` command.
</Callout>

## Server File Structure

Here is an example of the file structure for a server:

<Files>
  <Folder name="running" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="dynamic" defaultOpen>
      <Folder name="lobby" defaultOpen>
        <Folder name="lobby-1" defaultOpen>
          <Folder name="logs" />
          <Folder name="plugins" />
          <Folder name="worlds" />
          <File name="server.properties" />
        </Folder>
      </Folder>
    </Folder>
    <Folder name="static" defaultOpen>
      <Folder name="survival" defaultOpen>
        <Folder name="survival-1" defaultOpen>
          <Folder name="logs" />
          <Folder name="plugins" />
          <Folder name="worlds" />
          <File name="server.properties" />
        </Folder>
      </Folder>
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</Files>
