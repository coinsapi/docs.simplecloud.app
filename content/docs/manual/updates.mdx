  Keep your SimpleCloud installation up to date with our built-in update mechanisms

## Automatic Updates

SimpleCloud automatically checks for updates when you start the cloud. This means:

- When you start SimpleCloud, it checks for newer versions
- If updates are available, they're downloaded and applied automatically
- Your configuration files are preserved during updates
- The cloud restarts with the new version where necessary

This hands-off approach ensures you're always running the latest version without manual intervention.

## Updating the CLI

The CLI is your primary interface with SimpleCloud and can be updated using:

```bash
simplecloud upgrade cli
```

This command checks for a newer version of the CLI, downloads it, and replaces your current installation.

## Handling Breaking Changes with Migrations

Occasionally, SimpleCloud may introduce breaking changes that require manual migration steps. For these cases, we provide the `migrate` command:

```bash
simplecloud migrate [version]
```

This command guides you through any necessary migration steps for moving between major versions or handling significant changes that can't be applied automatically.

For example, migrating to version 3.0.0-beta.1:

```bash
simplecloud migrate 3.0.0-beta.1
```

  The migrate command is only needed in specific cases where breaking changes
  are introduced. For regular updates, the automatic update system handles
  everything for you.

## Best Practices

- **Stay Updated**: Since updates happen automatically, it's best to restart the cloud periodically to ensure you have the latest version
- **Backup First**: Before a major version migration, always create a backup of your configuration files
- **Check Changelog**: Review the changelog for major versions to understand what has changed before migrating
- **Test Migrations**: For production environments, test migrations on a staging system first

<Callout type="warn">
  If you're running a custom or modified version of SimpleCloud, automatic
  updates might overwrite your changes. Consider creating a backup before
  restarting the cloud.
