## Understanding Droplets

Droplets are a powerful way to extend SimpleCloud's functionality without writing a full application. Each droplet (microservice) focuses on doing one thing well, making it easy to maintain and scale.

Key benefits of the droplet system:

- Decoupled architecture allowing selective use of components
- Easy installation and management
- Focused functionality for better maintenance
- Scalable design for growing deployments

## Installing a Droplet

Using the SimpleCloud CLI, you can easily manage droplets:

```bash
# Install a droplet
sc install <droplet-name>

# List all available droplets
sc info droplets
```

## Droplets vs v2 Modules

Droplets are not direct replacements for v2 modules. While some droplets may share similarities with existing v2 modules, our focus has shifted:

- Most old module functionality is now available as plugins for Velocity, BungeeCord, or Spigot
- V2 modules are being converted into simplified [plugins](/docs/manual/plugin/overview)
- Droplets focus on infrastructure and service-level functionality

## Creating Droplets

A droplet is essentially a microservice that you can create using any technology stack. However, our official droplets typically use the following technologies:

| Technology        | Purpose                      |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Kotlin            | Primary programming language |
| ProtoBuf          | Data serialization           |
| gRPC              | Service communication        |
| SQLite/PostgreSQL | Data storage                 |
| JOOQ              | Database access              |
| Docker            | Containerization             |

  This is our preferred tech stack, but you can use any technology to create
  your own droplets. Need help? Join our

## Official Droplets

SimpleCloud provides several official droplets to extend your setup:

| Droplet                                            | Description                |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| [Player](/docs/manual/droplet/player)              | Player data and management |
| [Resource Pack](/docs/manual/droplet/resourcepack) | Resource pack distribution |
