## Understanding Plugins

SimpleCloud plugins are server-side extensions that:

- Integrate directly with your Minecraft servers
- Provide in-game functionality and features
- Use the SimpleCloud API for cloud integration
- Support various server platforms (Velocity, Paper, etc.)

## Installing Plugins

Installing plugins is straightforward:

1. Download the plugin JAR file
2. Place it in your [server group's](/docs/manual/resources/groups) plugin folder
3. The folder location is defined by your [template](/docs/manual/resources/templates)

  For default plugin locations and directory structure, refer to our [structure
  documentation](/docs/manual/structure).

## Plugins vs v2 Modules

In SimpleCloud v3, we've simplified our extension system:

- Most v2 modules providing in-game functionality are now plugins
- Plugins focus on server-side features (e.g., signs, NPCs)
- Infrastructure features are handled by [droplets](/docs/manual/droplet/overview)
