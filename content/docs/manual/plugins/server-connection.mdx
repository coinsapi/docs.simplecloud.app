## Overview

The Server Connection Plugin provides comprehensive player connection management for your network, including network join handling, fallback servers, and navigation commands.

## Supported Software

| Software   | Plugin Support | Server API Support |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| Velocity   | âœ… Full        | âœ… Yes             |

<Callout>
  *Support for other proxies is possible through custom implementation if the
  [server API](/manual/api#server) is available in your preferred [programming
  language](/manual/api).
</Callout>

## Quick Setup

1. Download the plugin from [GitHub](https://github.com/simplecloudapp/server-connection-plugin/releases)
2. Place it in your proxy template's plugins folder
3. Configure using `config.yml`

## Connection Targets

Connection targets define how servers in your network are matched and accessed. Each target can have specific rules for server name matching and player access.

Example configuration:

```yaml
connections:
  # Match servers starting with "lobby"
  - name: "lobby"
    server-name-matcher:
      operation: "STARTS_WITH"
      value: "lobby"

  # Match specific server with access rules
  - name: "skyblock-spawn"
    server-name-matcher:
      operation: "EQUALS"
      value: "sb-spawn"
    rules:
      # Permission rule
      - type: "PERMISSION"
        name: "network.join.skyblock"
        value: "true"

      # Environment variable rule
      - type: "ENV"
        name: "SKYBLOCK_JOIN_STATE"
        value: "maintenance"
        operation: "EQUALS"
        negate: true
        bypassPermission: "rank.admin"
```

### Server Name Matchers

Available matching operations:

| Operation     | Description         |
| ------------- | ------------------- |
| `EQUALS`      | Exact match         |
| `STARTS_WITH` | Prefix match        |
| `ENDS_WITH`   | Suffix match        |
| `CONTAINS`    | Substring match     |
| `REGEX`       | RegEx pattern match |

### Access Rules

Two types of rules are available:

1. **Permission Rules**:

```yaml
- type: "PERMISSION"
  name: "network.join.skyblock"
  value: "true"
  bypassPermission: "rank.admin" # Optional
```

2. **Environment Variable Rules**:

```yaml
- type: "ENV"
  name: "SKYBLOCK_JOIN_STATE"
  value: "maintenance"
  operation: "EQUALS"
  negate: true
  bypassPermission: "rank.admin" # Optional
```

## Features

<Callout>
  All message variables support [MiniMessage
  format](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format#standard-tags) for styling.
</Callout>

### Network Join Targets

Manages initial server connections:

```yaml
network-join-targets:
  enabled: true
  no-target-connections-found-message: "<color:red>No target servers available."
  target-connections:
    - name: "lobby"
      priority: 0
```

### Fallback Connections

Handles player redirection on kicks or shutdowns:

```yaml
fallback-connections:
  enabled: true
  no-target-connections-found-message: "No fallback servers available."
  target-connections:
    - name: "lobby"
      priority: 0
```

### Navigation Commands

Create server navigation commands:

```yaml
commands:
  - name: "lobby"
    aliases: ["hub"]
    target-connections:
      - name: "lobby"
        priority: 0
    already-connected-message: "<red>Already in lobby!"
    no-target-connections-found-message: "No lobby servers available."
    permission: "command.lobby" # Optional
```

## Example Configurations

### Game Server Setup

```yaml
connections:
  - name: "lobby"
    server-name-matcher:
      operation: "STARTS_WITH"
      value: "lobby"
  - name: "bedwars"
    server-name-matcher:
      operation: "STARTS_WITH"
      value: "bw"
    rules:
      - type: "PERMISSION"
        name: "minigame.bedwars"
        value: "true"

network-join-target:
  enabled: true
  target-connections:
    - name: "lobby"
      priority: 0

fallback-connections:
  enabled: true
  target-connections:
    - name: "lobby"
      priority: 0
    - name: "bedwars"
      priority: 1
      from:
        - operation: "STARTS_WITH"
          value: "bw"

commands:
  - name: "lobby"
    aliases: ["hub", "l"]
    target-connections:
      - name: "lobby"
        priority: 0
  - name: "bedwars"
    aliases: ["bw"]
    permission: "minigame.bedwars"
    target-connections:
      - name: "bedwars"
        priority: 0
```
