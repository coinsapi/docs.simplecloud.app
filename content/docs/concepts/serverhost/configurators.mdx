## Understanding Configurators

A server Configurator is a YML-file that provides information needed for a minecraft server to work with the cloud.
In most cases, it is responsible for setting the maximum players, port, online and forwarding mode of the server.
It is executed after the server template was copied to a new server. After it finishes executing, the server is started.

## Using Placeholders

When defining a Configurator, you can use placeholders for any [controller](/manual/resources/server-group#controller-properties) or [dynamic](/manual/resources/server-group#dynamic-properties) property using this syntax: `%property-name%`.

## Location and Assignment

Configurators are located in the `components/serverhost/options/configurators` directory. If you want, you can create your own or modify existing ones.
To assign a configurator to a server, you need to set the [dynamic group property](/manual/resources/server-group#dynamic-properties) `configurator` to the configurator id.
The configurator id is equivalent to the configurator file name without the file extension (e.g. `velocity.yml` -> `velocity`)
