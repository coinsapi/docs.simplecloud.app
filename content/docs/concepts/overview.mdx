  The SimpleCloud is a collection of components that work together to provide a seamless Minecraft server experience.

## Key Components

- **Controller**: The heart of v3, managing server groups, online servers, and communicating with Server Hosts.
- **CLI** (Command Line Interface): A lightweight interface to connect to the Controller and manage your Cloud components. With the [CLI](/docs/concepts/cli), you can send commands to the controller or install and manage droplets.
- **Server Host**: Handles server startup/shutdown with templates, running on Screens or Docker containers.
- **Droplets & Plugins**:
  - **Droplets**: Microservices for non-Minecraft tasks, but still with Minecraft related features like player data (Player Droplet) or Resourcepacks (Resourcepack Droplet).
  - **Plugins**: Enhance server features with Proxy (e.g., Notify, CloudCommand) or Server Plugins (e.g., Signs, NPCs).

## Structure

SimpleCloud v3 has a new and more customizable structure. We have encapsulated all the core components to make it easier to extend your setup. This means you can easily replace all our [droplets](/docs/manual/droplets) and [plugins](/docs/manual/plugin) with your own implementations.

## File Structure

SimpleCloud has its core components that are needed, but they can be installed and used however you want. This means theoretically you can use any file structure you want.

<Callout type="warn">
  We **don't recommend** using a custom file structure. Use the structure below
  as it works best in our experience and makes it easier to extend your setup
  with our [CLI](/docs/concepts/cli).

  things that will not work with our [CLI](/docs/concepts/cli).

## Understanding Components

SimpleCloud v3 is structured into components - a broad category that includes both core system elements and [droplets](/docs/manual/droplets). These components serve as the building blocks of the system, encompassing essential elements like the [Controller](/docs/concepts/controller), [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) (necessary for the Dashboard), the Auto-updater, and the [CLI](/docs/concepts/cli), alongside [droplets](/docs/manual/droplets).

We chose to use the term "components" to reflect this inclusive scope. This generic terminology allows us to consistently refer to all parts of the system, whether they are core elements or [droplets](/docs/manual/droplets).

## Auto-Updater

The auto-updater is a crucial part of SimpleCloud, ensuring that all components stay up-to-date with the latest features and security patches. It resides in the `components/auto-updater` directory and manages version control through `versions.yml`. The auto-updater is configured through its own `application.yml` file and updates itself before updating other components.

### Component Properties

Every component is built and configured to use properties files for configuration. The properties file is located in the `components` folder and named `{component}.properties`.

Here's an example of a properties file:

```properties
DATABASE_URL=jdbc:sqlite:database.db
GROUPS_PATH=../../groups
# GRPC Uncomment and change this if you want to change grpc defintions
GRPC_HOST=0.0.0.0
# GRPC_PORT=5816
# PUBSUB Uncomment and change this if you want to run pubsub on another port
# PUBSUB_GRPC_PORT=5817
AUTH_SECRET_PATH=../.secrets/auth.secret
```
