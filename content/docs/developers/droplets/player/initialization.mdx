## Dependencies

Before you can use the Player API, you need to add our dependencies to your project.

Please refer to following guides, depending on your platform:

- [Velocity](/docs/developers/getting-started/velocity)
- [BungeeCord](/docs/developers/getting-started/bungeecord)
- [Paper](/docs/developers/getting-started/paper)
- [Standalone](/docs/developers/getting-started/standalone)
- [Other](/docs/developers/getting-started/other)

## Initialization

After adding the dependencies, you can initialize the Player API.

### Initialize with Default Configuration

If you are using the Player API in any platform, we automatically set the secret token with `PLAYER_SECRET` environment variable.

```kotlin tab="Kotlin"
val playerApi = PlayerApi.createCoroutineApi()
```

```java tab="Java"
PlayerApi.Future playerApi = PlayerApi.createFutureApi();
```

### Connect with Secret Token

```kotlin tab="Kotlin"
val playerApi = PlayerApi.createCoroutineApi("your-secret-key")
```

```java tab="Java"
PlayerApi.Future playerApi = PlayerApi.createFutureApi("your-secret-key");
```

<Callout>
    You can find your secret in `<installation-dir>/components/.secrets/auth.secret`
</Callout>

## Best Practices

- **Multiple Instances**: Don't create multiple instances of the Player API. While it's possible to create multiple instances, we don't recommend it. Just create a single instance and use it everywhere (preferd with dependency injection).
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Use `Coroutines` for asynchronous operations in Kotlin, or `CompletableFuture` for Java. We don't recommend using our API in sync operations.
- **Error Handling**: We don't throw any exceptions, we return `null` or `Future` objects. You should handle errors by yourself.
